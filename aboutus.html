        <h4>About Us</h4>

        <p>
          With innovative approaches and advanced methodologies, Vecta Corp.
          provides scalable business solutions to help companies achieve success
          through revenue increase, cost management and user satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach stems from the three most important business growth
          aspects: helping companies reach prospects, assist in converting
          prospects to customers, and assist in retaining those customers. This
          is accomplished through our interactive solutions and expertise in
          providing a memorable and positive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to effectively prospect, convert and retain, the user
          experience is placed at the center of all our development projects.
          Providing unique, memorable and positive experiences, striking the
          appropriate emotional connection and reducing mental effort required
          to interact with the site ultimately results in higher prospect
          conversion and customer retention figures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our expertise in strategy, design and technology allows us to create
          business solutions that excite and inspire, are easy to navigate, and
          enable businesses to strengthen their competitive advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          With increased conversion and retention, our solutions provide
          companies with opportunities to increase revenues and enhance
          productivity. This is how we helped Dorknozzle achieve remarkable
          success, including more than doubling their customer base from 20,000
          to 70,000 within 15 months of launching a Vecta Corp. solution.
